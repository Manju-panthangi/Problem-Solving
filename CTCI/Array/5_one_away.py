"""
One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character,
remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are
one edit (or zero edits) away.
EXAMPLE
pale, ple   ->  true
pales, pale ->  true
pale, bale  ->  true
pale, bake  ->  false

Hints:
#23     :   Start with the easy thing. Can you check each of the conditions separately
#97     :   What is the relationship between the "insert character" option and the "remove charÂ­acter" option? Do these need to be two separate checks?
#130    :   Can you do all three checks in a single pass?
"""

"""
Replacement: Consider two strings, such as bale and pale, that are one replacement away. Yes, that
does mean that you could replace a character in bale to make pale. But more precisely, it means that
they are different only in one place.

Insertion: The strings apple and aple are one insertion away. This means that if you compared the
strings, they would be identical-except for a shift at some point in the strings.

Removal: The strings apple and aple are also one removal away, since removal is just the inverse of
insertion.
